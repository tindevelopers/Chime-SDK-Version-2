## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL client
- Docker (for local development)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Database
DB_HOST=video-conferencing-dev.cluster-clrcltlw1dlu.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=video_conferencing
DB_USER=dbadmin
DB_PASSWORD=VideoConf2025!

# Cognito
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_2lpfwBcaO
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=uus0oqfhqto7lo0rud3nco8a0
COGNITO_REGION=us-east-1

# ChimeSDK
CHIME_REGION=us-east-1

# API Gateway
API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-gateway-url.amazonaws.com/prod
```

## üìä Database Schema

### Core Tables with ChimeSDK Integration
- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `meetings` - Meeting information with ChimeSDK meeting IDs
- `meeting_participants` - Participant tracking with ChimeSDK attendee IDs
- `chat_messages` - Meeting chat history
- `recordings` - Meeting recordings metadata with ChimeSDK pipeline IDs
- `voice_connectors` - ChimeSDK Voice Connector configurations
- `phone_numbers` - PSTN phone numbers for voice calling

## üîê Authentication Flow

1. User registers/signs in via Cognito
2. Cognito returns JWT tokens
3. Frontend includes tokens in API requests
4. Lambda functions validate tokens
5. Database operations performed with user context
6. ChimeSDK operations executed with proper permissions

## üé• ChimeSDK Integration

### Meeting Management
- **Create Meeting**: Lambda creates ChimeSDK meeting + database record
- **Join Meeting**: Lambda creates ChimeSDK attendee + database participant
- **End Meeting**: Lambda deletes ChimeSDK meeting + updates database
- **Meeting Features**: HD video, echo reduction, content sharing

### Voice/PSTN Integration
- **Voice Connectors**: Manage PSTN calling infrastructure
- **Phone Numbers**: Order and manage phone numbers
- **SIP Applications**: Custom voice applications
- **SIP Rules**: Route calls based on rules

### Recording & Media
- **Media Pipelines**: Record meetings to S3
- **Transcription**: Real-time meeting transcription
- **Content Capture**: Screen sharing and content recording

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Development Environment
- **Aurora Serverless v2**: Min 0.5 ACU, Max 8 ACU
- **ChimeSDK**: Pay per meeting minute + attendee
- **Lambda**: Pay per request (minimal cost)
- **Cognito**: Free tier (50,000 MAUs)
- **Estimated Cost**: $20-50/month during development

### Production Considerations
- **Min ACU**: 2-4 for production responsiveness
- **Max ACU**: 32-64 for high traffic
- **ChimeSDK**: Scale with usage
- **Multi-AZ**: Enabled for reliability

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Set up local development environment**
2. **Create database schema and migrations**
3. **Build authentication flow**
4. **Develop core API endpoints**
5. **Create frontend interface**
6. **Test ChimeSDK integration**
